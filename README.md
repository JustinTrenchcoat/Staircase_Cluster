## Summary

This repository contains the code used by the above study to apply the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) clustering algorithm to data from Ice Tethered Profilers.

A detailed explanation of how the code was used to make each plot in the study can be found in the accompanying Jupyter notebook `Create_Figures.ipynb`.
